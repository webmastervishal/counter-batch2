/*

    Difference between container/stateful & presentational/stateless component

    1. container will have class defination while presentational will have function
    2. Inside the container we will write the logic required for the component to work, whereas presentational component will just render the data 
    3. container will have all the lifecycle methods provided by React.Component class.
    4. container can have state which will hold the data required by the component, presentational will render the state data.
    5. container is called stateful because it holds the state data, presentational is called stateless because it doesn't have state
